# week7prac
The validate.py file is to be used in your solutions for the week 7 prac exercises. You may initially need to copy the code into your python script to get it to work but I want you to be able to *import* the code before the end of the prac to improve code reusability.

BookShop.txt contains pseudocode for the exercise.
